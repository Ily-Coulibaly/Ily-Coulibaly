### Hi there (:,  

My name is Ily, and I am a data Analyst and mathematician interested in all things Python and data-driven problem solving.  

- I am currently working on a meeting analyzer tool that evaluates transcripts to generate real-time engagement dashboard in order to improve meeting efficiency. 
- I recently developed a Python and NLP tool that indexed over 1,000 documents and automated report generation, reducing retrieval and reporting time by 80%.  
- I am eager to collaborate on projects that use programming, machine learning, and data visualization to improve business efficiency, and support evidence-based decision-making.
